# webdriver-sync

Synchronous testing with Selenium and node.js!

## Highlights

* Write 100% selenium in javascript!
* Run Chrome, Firefox, Safari, PhantomJS, Internet Explorer, and RemoteWebDriver (Android to come)!
* Reduce code by embracing a synchronous API!
* Reduce verbosity found in statically typed langs like java and c#
* Forget about dependency management for 3rd party binaries I.E. chromedriver and selenium-server-standalone-x.x.x.jar.  Say hello to an install process that handles all that for you.
* Connect to Sauce using the RemoteWebDriver or other drivers that extend RemoteWebDriver.

## Why Sync?

Prior to node, most of my testing was done in Java and JUnit.  I found the sync
API to be much easier to follow and maintain, and I wasn't happy with all the
async ceremony out there with the node APIs (similar to the following):

``````javascript
browser.get("http://foo.html", function() {
   browser.title(function(err, title) {
     assert.ok(~title.indexOf('foo title'), 'Wrong title!');
     browser.elementById('i am a link', function(err, el) {
        browser.clickElement(el, function() {
           browser.eval("window.location.href", function(err, href) {
           assert.ok(~href.indexOf('foo title 2'));
           browser.quit();
           });
        });
     });
   });
});
``````

I much prefer this:

``````javascript
driver.get("http://foo.html");
title = driver.getTitle();
link  = driver.findElement(By.id('i am a link'));
link.click();
assert(driver.getCurrentUrl().indexOf('foo title 2') > -1);
assert(title.indexOf('foo title') > -1);
driver.quit();
``````

And that's exactly what `webdriver-sync` aims to achieve.  It should look just
like the java API provided by the Selenium organization, but without the static typing.

## Example
````javascript
var wd = require('webdriver-sync');
var By            = wd.By;
var ChromeDriver  = wd.ChromeDriver;
var driver        = new ChromeDriver;
var title;
var link;

driver.get("http://foo.html");
title= driver.getTitle();
link = driver.findElement(By.id('i am a link'));
link.click();

assert(driver.getCurrentUrl().indexOf('foo title 2') > -1);
assert(title.indexOf('foo title') > -1);
driver.quit();
````

<b>Note:</b> You can avoid `var By = wd.By;` by using `wd.exportTo(global);` to further
reduce verbosity.

## Installation
`npm install webdriver-sync`

This package requires java and the java opensdk.
* Linux: 
   * RHEL # `yum install -y java-devel`
   * Debian/Ubuntu # `apt-get install java-sdk`


`webdriver-sync` will download needed binaries for you which makes your life
easier.  `webdriver-sync` will download these binaries to `$HOME/.webdriver-sync`.
The following list has ways of overriding this process:

* Chromdriver - Place `chromedriver` or `chromedriver.exe` (for windows) on your
path.
* Selenium jar - Set `SELENIUM_SERVER_STANDALONE_JAR` to point to the location 
where you have it on disk.  You should never do this, as the API is only tested
against specific versions selenium, but it is available.

##Documentation
As `webdriver-sync` is a wrapper around the java API, you can browse any of the
javadocs online.  You can quite literally use this module the same way you
would in java without the static typing.

Working with Maps and Lists is extremely delightful in javascript:
````javascript
  driver.executeScript("return document.querySelectorAll('div');").forEach(function(el){
    console.log(el.getText());
  });
````

##Running Headless
You can run Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and PhantomJS headless with `webdriver-sync`!
You must have `Xvfb` installed, or an equivalent.

Here's how Chromdriver can be run headless:
````shell
#Run this on a tty
Xvfb :99 > /dev/null &
````

````javascript
//Use this in your tests
var service = new ChromeDriverService.Builder()
    .usingAnyFreePort()
    .usingDriverExecutable(new File(findsChromeDriver.find()))
    .withEnvironment({"DISPLAY":":99.0"})
    .build();

var driver = new ChromeDriver(service);
//Running Headless!
````
